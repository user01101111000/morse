        <h1>Samuel Morse</h1>

        <p>
          Samuel Morse (1791â€“1872) was an American inventor, painter, and
          co-developer of the Morse code, a breakthrough system for
          long-distance communication. Initially trained as a painter, Morse
          studied at Yale and showed a keen interest in both the arts and
          emerging science, particularly in electricity. He became a respected
          artist, known for his portraits, and traveled to Europe to refine his
          painting skills. However, his path took a dramatic turn in the 1830s,
          leading him to focus on telegraphy and communication technology.
